This is an assignment made for STORD the logistics services & software company.


## Requirements

There are a few things that are assumed to exist in your settup or are otherwise encouraged to have.

* A postgresql service running in the background
* asdf to install dependencies (optional)


In case of a missing postgres installation one can be easily spawned through docker using the following command.

```
docker run -d \
    --name postgres \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
    -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    postgres
```

Note that the postgres password is set to 'postgres', the app will try to connect to the user `postgres` with password `postgres`. This is hardcoded at the moment and can be changed in the elixir `dev.exs` config.

For asdf there is a guide on their webpage. If you already have elixir and node installed in your system you can skip this part.

## Settup
To settup the application locally, the following commands should be run.

> `make pre-setup` -> (Optional) Will install elixir, erlang and node through asdf

> `make setup` -> Will setup the elixir application.

> `make run-test` -> Will run tests

> `make run-lint` -> Will lint for types and code quality as well as run the formatter

> `make server` -> Will run the server, visit http://localhost:8080 to view it
